# MSc-thesis---Dependency-injection-in-serverless-scenarios
MSc thesis. title: "Dependency injection in serverless scenarios"

workflow:
1) re-implement the tests made on Azure and AWS (basic dependency injection of a function, need to choose how to implement the registry)
2) other examples with functions that implement access control and logging
3) evaluate the performance
4) modify the infrastructure in order to optimize the situation in which the dependecy providers are on the same node of the clients
6) evaluate the performance
